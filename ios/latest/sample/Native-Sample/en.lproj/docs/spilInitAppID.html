This method creates the instance for the first time. It should be created as soon as possible during the loading process because this method makes a call to our servers to download game configuration data like Flurry keys, Chartboost keys, AppSettings, and so on. Moreover, it initializes the sub-systems to make them available for calls as soon as possible.
Delaying initialization prevents some tracking events and actions from being executed because the system is not completely initialized.

You need to receive the following details from Spil Games to use this method:
- appID, and
- A token.
These values are cross-platform: for a given app, you can use the same appID/topken pair for all three stores.
In the configs parameter you need to specify the environment and the store you want to use.

An initialization example is available below. If you click the trigger button on the top, the code given below will be executed.
