This method provides the low-level functionality encapsulated in adsRequestInGameAd. It provides the interface for the Unity plugin. At least the method above doesn't meet your needs, stick to it.
Asset download, error handling and image scaling, are left to the developer.

The parameter received with this function will be a block that is called when the ad info is downloaded or when an error occurs.

The info received by the block contains the ad identifier: adId. This property is used to flag an ad as viewed; you need to store it, otherwise the same ad will be served repeatedly.
