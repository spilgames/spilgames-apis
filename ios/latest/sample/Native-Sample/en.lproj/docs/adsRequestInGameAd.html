This method requests an ad from the default location. The ad will be contained within the defined size.
This method returns immediately; it returns YES or NO, depending on whether the ad can be requested or not.

When the server returns an ad, the best fitting image with either landscape or portrait orientation is selected, based on the size value defined as a parameter. Then, a clickable UIView is returned on the InGameAdsDelegate method. You need to place this reference as necessary.
