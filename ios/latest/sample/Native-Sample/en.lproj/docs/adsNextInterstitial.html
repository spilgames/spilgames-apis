This method allows you to show an interstitial ad immediately.
The interstitial ad to be shown is selected from the default location. If you want to configure more specific options, the adsNextInterstitialWithLocation method allows you to get more targeted results, for example by fine-tuning the Chartboost dashboard settings, and by specifying different locations for the ads.
The framework automatically caches the following interstitial ad to be displayed on the same position to improve ad serving speed.
