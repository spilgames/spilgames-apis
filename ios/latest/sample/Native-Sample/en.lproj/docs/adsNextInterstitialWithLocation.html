This method allows you to show an interstitial ad immediately.
When a location is specified, it is possible to fine-tune the Chartboost settings to show more or fewer ads, or to show specific ad types in that position.

For example, on the main menu you may wish to display an ad every 24 hours, whereas on the pause menu you want to trigger an ad display every time the menu becomes available to the user. You may want to show an ad after completing a level, or every 2 hours.

You can define these settings only if you use adsNextInterstitialWithLocation; they are not available in the adsNextInterstitial method.
The framework automatically caches the following interstitial ad to be displayed on the same position to improve ad serving speed.
