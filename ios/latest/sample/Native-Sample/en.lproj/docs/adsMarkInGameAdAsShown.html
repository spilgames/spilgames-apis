This method complements the low-level functionality of adsRequestInGameAdAsset*. It provides the interface for the Unity plugin. At least the method above doesn't meet your needs, stick to it.

Once the ad is displayed, it should be flagged to register the ad impression. This is necessary to accurately track ad views/clicks, and to record the number of ads displayed. Without this call the user is served more ads, but they don't generate any revenue.
