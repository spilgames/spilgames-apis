In-game ads are less intrusive and user-friendlier than traditional advertising. Their main strength is that they generate impressions and revenue without disrupting user experience. In-game ads work like product placement in the movie industry, where a branded product is shown to viewers (think about the Audi RSQ Will Smith drives in "I, Robot"), or the brand is featured in a billboard or on the background in the movie.

In-game ads rely on the Ads module. To use them, you need to:
- Implement AdsDelegate;
- Implement InGameAdsDelegate;
- Set InGameAdsDelegate using the setInGameAdsDelegate method.
This allows you to obtain the necessary info and place the ad wherever appropriate.

After the spil object is initialized, this call will register the delegate and it will notify when the ads subsystem is ready to be use.
Wait until the adDidStart delegate's method is called, otherwise, all call will be ignored.

To keep the example below as simple as possible, self is used as the implementation of the protocol.
Check the implementation of the protocol in the DetailsViewController.m file.
Feel free to implement it as necessary.
