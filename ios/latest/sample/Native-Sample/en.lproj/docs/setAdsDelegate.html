In order to receive ads and more games from the framework, you need to set an AdsDelegate: implement the AdsDelegate protocol in one object, as necessary, then pass the reference to AdsDelegate as the single parameter this function takes.

After initializing the spil object, this call performs the following actions:
- It registers the delegate, and
- It sends a notification as soon as the ads sub-system is ready for use.

Note: you need to wait for the adDidStart delegate method to be called; otherwise, any calls are ignored.
To keep the example below as simple as possible, self is used as the implementation of the protocol.

Check the implementation of the protocol in the DetailsViewController.m file.
Feel free to implement it as necessary.
