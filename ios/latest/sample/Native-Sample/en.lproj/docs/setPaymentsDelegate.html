In order to make payments (in-app purchases) from the framework, you need to set an PaymentsDelegate: implement the PaymentsDelegate protocol in one object, as necessary, then pass the reference to PaymentsDelegate as the single parameter this function takes.

After initializing the spil object, this call performs the following actions:
- It registers the delegate, and
- It sends a notification as soon as the payments sub-system is ready for use.
- It download the list of available products directly from the App Store and sends the back to the delegate,

Note: you need to wait for the paymentsDidStart delegate method to be called; otherwise, any calls are ignored.
To keep the example below as simple as possible, self is used as the implementation of the protocol.

Check the implementation of the protocol in the DetailsViewController.m file.
Feel free to implement it as necessary.
