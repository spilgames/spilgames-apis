Tracks an event. An event can be an action taken on an object like unlocking an achievement, or getting a highscore value.
In Google Analytics these events are registered as "category"="event"; the event is passed as a parameter of the action taken.
In Flurry, an event with parameters is created and the parameters match Google Analytics's ones (category,action,label,value).
