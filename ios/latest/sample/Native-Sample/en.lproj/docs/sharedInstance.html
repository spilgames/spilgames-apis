After using the previous method to initialize the instance, you can use this method to retrieve the same instance repeatedly.
You can store the instance returned with this method to use it at a later time, or you can use this method directly every time you call a function.

Important: don't use this method before the spilWithAppId call. Otherwise, all calls are dropped.
